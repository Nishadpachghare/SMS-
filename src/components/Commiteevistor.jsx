Residents can register or pre-approve visitors in advance using the system, which automatically generates a unique QR code for each guest. This QR code allows for quick and hassle-free entry at the society gate, reducing waiting times and improving security. Residents can track and view the full history of all visitors, including dates, times, and purpose of visit, and they also receive instant notifications as soon as their guest arrives. During busy occasions like family gatherings, festivals, or community events, this feature ensures smooth entry management and avoids unnecessary crowding at the gate. Super Admins can access and monitor visitor data across all societies under their management, helping them detect unusual activity, address security concerns promptly, and maintain a safe environment for residents at all times.</p>

        <p className=' text-[20px] pr-15 pt-5'>Pre-Approve Visitors allows residents to approve their guests before they arrive, directly through the mobile app. Once approved, the system automatically generates a unique QR code for each visitor, which they can show at the gate for quick entry. This saves time, avoids long waits, and ensures a smooth check-in process. It also improves security by keeping a record of all approved visitors, making it easy to track who is entering the society and when.</p>
