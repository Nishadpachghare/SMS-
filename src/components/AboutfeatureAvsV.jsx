    Apartment vs Villa Workflow
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
       Indian societies vary widely—high-rise apartments in Mumbai face different challenges than sprawling villa communities in Bengaluru. SMS is tailored for both. Apartments benefit from centralized automation, like flat-wise billing and shared facility bookings, while villas get personalized maintenance plans and private visitor logs. Super Admins manage multiple societies, adding or deleting as needed, while Society Admins handle local tasks like parking assignments. Push notifications keep residents updated, ensuring no one misses a monsoon repair notice or a festival event.
