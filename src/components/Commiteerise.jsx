Residents can easily submit complaints through the mobile app for any issues they face in the society, such as lift breakdowns, water supply problems, or electrical faults. They can even attach photos to clearly show the problem, making it easier for the management team to understand the situation. Once submitted, the resident can track the complaint’s progress in real time, from acknowledgment to resolution. Society Admins receive these complaints, assign them to the right staff or service providers, and monitor the work until it’s completed. Super Admins, on the other hand, can view and manage complaints across multiple societies, ensuring no issue is left unattended.</p>
