   Bookkeeping in Indian societies often leads to confusion, especially during annual audits. SMS’s ledger and audit logs track every transaction—maintenance payments, vendor disbursements, or festival contributions—with timestamps and user details. Society Admins manage single-society records, ensuring clarity for local audits, while Super Admins access consolidated logs across multiple societies for township-level oversight. Exportable reports in CSV/PDF formats make audit prep simple, tackling issues like misplaced records or disputed payments. With encrypted storage and 2FA, SMS ensures secure, transparent financial tracking for Indian communities.
