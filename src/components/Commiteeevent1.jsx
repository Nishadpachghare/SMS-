Residents get instant push notifications on their mobile devices for all upcoming society events, such as Independence Day celebrations, community meetings, cultural programs, or festival gatherings. These notifications include key details like the event name, date, time, venue, and a short description, along with a digital invitation they can view anytime. This ensures residents never miss important occasions and can plan their participation in advance. An RSVP feature is also in development, which will allow residents to confirm their attendance directly through the app, helping organizers better prepare for the event. Society Admins can easily schedule and manage events in the system, send timely reminders, and make updates if any changes occur.</p>
